<p>You are now in the Historic City of Boston, the Birthplace
of American Liberty.</p>
<p>The Boston you see around you today is the capital city
of the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with a population,
in its Greater Boston area, of 2,307,897, and it
covers 1022.6 square miles. The town was settled over
three hundred years ago by a God-loving people of rugged
character, industry and vision. Today it has grown into
this great modern manufacturing and commercial center.
It boasts of two hundred universities, colleges and schools,
of which the major ones are Boston University, Harvard,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Radcliffe, Wellesley,
Tufts, Simmons, Boston College, New England
Conservatory of Music, Northeastern, and Massachusetts
School of Art. There are two hundred and twenty-four
public libraries available with more than four million books.
There are five museums open to the public.</p>
<p>This little book has been designed by the <span class="sc">American Oil
Company</span> for your convenience during your stay in this historic
town and has been divided into five tours, each of
which may be made easily in a day&rsquo;s time.</p>

<br /><span class="large"><i>BOSTON</i></span><br /><span class="large">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>The Start: Leaving the Providence Street side of the Hotel
Statler, walk directly ahead on Arlington Street one block to
Boylston Street. Turn right, proceed on Boylston Street to Charles
Street, at which point we cross to the</p>
<h3>Boston Common</h3>
<p>The Boston Common is a tract of land, containing nearly fifty
acres, bought in 1634 by Governor Winthrop and others from
William Blaxton, who held his title by right of possession gained
prior to the settlement of Boston in 1630. It was set apart for common
use as a cow pasture and training field, and amusingly still
retains that status. As you enter the Common, pause for a moment
at the little cemetery on the Boylston Street side for here lies
buried Gilbert Stuart, the noted portrait painter, and also a number
of prominent Boston citizens.</p>
<p>Proceeding through the Common, we view the Soldiers&rsquo; Monument
which crowns Flagstaff Hill where British Artillery was stationed
during the siege of Boston, when troops were quartered and
entrenched there. From what is now Park Square, the British
embarked for Lexington on April 18, 1775. On the Common, the
British mustered before the Battle of Bunker Hill and here also
gathered contingents for Colonial expeditions against Louisburg
and Quebec. Many Massachusetts regiments assembled here prior
to going to the front in the Civil War. On Beacon Street Mall, opposite
the State House, stands the Shaw monument by Augustus
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
St. Gaudens, a memorial to Colonel Robert G. Shaw and the
Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Infantry.</p>
<p>Continuing our stroll, we come to the Park and Tremont Street
side of the Common and directly across the street we find the old</p>
<h3>Park Street Church</h3>
<p>The Park Street Church was erected in 1810 on the site of the
Granary where the sails of the &ldquo;Constitution&rdquo; were made. Brimstone
was stored in the basement in 1812, giving the church the
name of &ldquo;Brimstone Corner.&rdquo; Here, on July 4, 1832, &ldquo;America&rdquo;
was first publicly sung.</p>
<p>Leaving the Park Street Church, we turn left on Tremont
Street and move on to the</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">OLD GRANARY BURYING GROUND</span></p>
</div>
<h3>Granary Cemetery</h3>
<p>Here lie buried most of the personages of Historic Boston. Nine
early governors&mdash;Bellingham, Dummer, Hancock, Bowdoin,
Eustis, Sumner, Adams, Sullivan and Gore. Also Peter Faneuil,
Paul Revere, the parents of Benjamin Franklin, Robert Treat
Paine, who was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence,
Mary Goose (Mother Goose), and Thomas Fleet, who
arranged and published the Mother Goose Rhymes. Here also lie
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
buried in one grave Crispus Attucks, Patrick Carr, James Caldwell,
Samuel Maverick and Samuel Gray, who were the victims of the
Boston Massacre. Buried in the same grave with these men is
Christopher Snyder, a twelve year old boy, the only person to lose
his life at the famous Boston Tea Party.</p>
<p>Leaving the Granary Cemetery, we cross Tremont Street and
turn left toward School Street, on the corner of which stands</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" alt="KING&rsquo;S CHAPEL" width="500" height="265" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">KING&rsquo;S CHAPEL</span></p>
</div>
<h3>King&rsquo;s Chapel</h3>
<p>King&rsquo;s Chapel was founded in 1686. The first chapel was built in
1688 the present one in 1749 of old English architecture. Here the
British worshipped during the siege. By a strange turn of events,
this Tory Church became the First Unitarian Church in the United
States in 1785. Although it is still considered Unitarian, it retains
many of its Episcopal symbols such as the cross, communion table,
Apostle&rsquo;s Creed and Ten Commandments on the altar. This Chapel
is open daily to the public from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m.</p>
<p>Leaving King&rsquo;s Chapel, turn right on Tremont Street and enter
the</p>
<h3>King&rsquo;s Chapel Burying Ground</h3>
<p>This was the first burial ground in Boston. A stone bearing the inscription
&ldquo;Captain Welden, February 18, 1630&rdquo; proves this statement.
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Here lie buried Governor John Winthrop, Lady Andros, wife
of Governor Andros, John Cotton, John Davenport, the founder
of New Haven, Conn., William Dawes, who made the famous ride
on another route with Paul Revere, Mary Chilton, who, according
to tradition, was the first woman of the Mayflower&rsquo;s little band to
touch the American soil. It is interesting to know that Charles
Dawes, the former Vice-President of the United States, may be
buried in the same grave as William Dawes, if he so desires. Few
burials have been made in King&rsquo;s Chapel since 1796. This very interesting
spot is open to the public from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m., daily.</p>
<p>Leaving the burial ground, we turn right on Tremont Street and
proceed to Court Street where we turn right and walk down to the
City Hall Annex, across from which is a tablet on the East corner
of Franklin Avenue which marks the</p>
<h3>Franklin Printing Office</h3>
<p>It was here that young Benjamin Franklin learned the printer&rsquo;s
trade in the office of James Franklin, his brother, where the &ldquo;New
England Courant&rdquo; was published.</p>
<p>We turn right, following the narrow alley and walk along the
City Hall Annex to School Street, where, if you will face to the
right, you will see a statue of Benjamin Franklin which marks the
first location of</p>
<h3>The Boston Public Latin School</h3>
<p>This gave the street its name. Here Franklin, Hancock, Samuel
Adams, Cotton Mather, Henry Ward Beecher, Edward Everett
Hale and many others received their early education.</p>
<p>Proceeding left on School Street, we come to Washington Street,
on the north corner of which stood the Old Corner Book Store
building, erected in 1712 and known far and wide as a center of
literature and a meeting place for book lovers.</p>
<p>Cross Washington Street, turn right and we come to the</p>
<h3>Old South Meeting House</h3>
<p>Here the men of Boston gathered to protest against forcing Massachusetts
citizens into the English Navy, to demand the withdrawal
of British troops and to decide the fate of the hated tax on
tea. It was used by the British as a riding school during the siege
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
of Boston. The present building, erected in 1789, is open from
9 a. m. to 4 p. m., daily. Admission, twenty-five cents.</p>
<p>Leaving the Meeting House, turn left to Milk Street. Almost
across the street, 17 Milk Street, was</p>
<h3>The Birthplace of Benjamin Franklin</h3>
<p>It is occupied today by a building housing the Boston Transcript.
Here is a bust of Franklin on the front of the building above the
second floor windows.</p>
<p>Retracing our steps, we turn right on Washington Street and
proceed to</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" alt="THE OLD STATE HOUSE" width="477" height="710" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">THE OLD STATE HOUSE</span></p>
</div>
<h3>The Old State House</h3>
<p>Here the first Town House was built in 1657 in the earliest market
place of Boston. The present building was built in 1713, burned in
1747, and immediately rebuilt with walls of the former building
being utilized. Here met Colonial Courts and Legislators, town and
city governments and the General Court of the Commonwealth.
It was used as a City Hall from 1830 to 1840. It is open to the
public from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m., daily. From the windows, one may
look out on the Washington Street side and see the site of Paul
Revere&rsquo;s Silver Shop.</p>
<p>Leaving the old State House, pause for a moment at Number 28
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
State Street. Here is another historic site where stood the Royal
Exchange Tavern, from which the first stage coach started to New
York on September 7, 1772, &ldquo;to go once every fourteen days.&rdquo;
Across the street, at 27 State Street, stood the first meeting house,
built by the Colonists in 1632. The church was a rude but substantial
edifice of mud walls with a thatched roof. The first pastor
was John Wilson, who had for his associate the Reverend John
Cotton, the former pastor of old St. Botolph&rsquo;s, Boston, England.</p>
<p>Proceeding down State Street to Number 30, we come to the
site of</p>
<h3>The Boston Massacre</h3>
<p>A tablet on the wall tells the story. A circle in the pavement
marks the place where fell the first martyrs in the cause of American
freedom. Continuing down State Street, we come to the</p>
<h3>Custom House</h3>
<p>For the minute, let us forget historic Boston and take a rapid trip
in the elevator to the tower 490 feet high where we may obtain a
wonderful panorama of the city and take a splendid aerial photograph
on a clear day.</p>
<p>Leaving the building, we turn right on Milk Street and proceed
to Oliver Street. Turn left on Oliver and follow to Atlantic Avenue
where you then turn right to Pearl Street. Here on a building is
a marker to the</p>
<h3>Boston Tea Party</h3>
<p>The marker reads &ldquo;Here formerly stood Griffin&rsquo;s Wharf at which
lay moored December 16, 1773, three British ships with cargoes of
tea. To defeat King George&rsquo;s trivial but tyrannical tax of three
pence per pound, about ninety citizens of Boston, partly disguised
as Indians, boarded the ships, threw the cargoes, three hundred and
forty-two chests in all, into the sea and made the world ring with
the patriotic exploit of The Boston Tea Party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving this most historic point, we retrace our steps back over
Atlantic Avenue for some distance to Market Street. There we turn
left and proceed along until we come to the Quincy Market where
we turn right and then left to North Market Street where we find</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3>The Durgin &amp; Park Restaurant</h3>
<p>Let us enter this old place. For over one hundred and fifty years it
has been used as a restaurant. Your grandfather or even your great
grandfather may have eaten here. We are met by a most gracious
host and food is served to us fresh from the market. When you
have eaten enough and absorbed a satisfying amount of the atmosphere
of this fascinating spot, you will find almost diagonally
across the street the famous old</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">FANEUIL HALL</span></p>
</div>
<h3>Faneuil Hall</h3>
<p>Faneuil Hall, affectionately called &ldquo;The Cradle of Liberty,&rdquo; was
built in 1742 by Peter Faneuil. It was given to Boston as a Town
Hall. Burned in 1761, it was rebuilt in 1763. This is one of the few
buildings in Boston which is in the same condition today as it originally
was, with the exception perhaps of steel staircases, electricity,
and steam heat. The Hall is still used for public meetings.
This was the center of Revolutionary movements in Boston and
the Colonies, and was used by the British officers as a playhouse
during the siege of Boston. The Hall has many historic paintings
and portraits. Don&rsquo;t fail to see the Military Museum and Library
of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company. It is well worth
the walk up to the third floor. Open week days from 9 a. m. to
5 p. m.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Leaving Faneuil Hall, proceed down North Street, passing the
AMOCO Service Station on your right. Directly across the street
and to the left we pass by the Sumner Tunnel which was opened
to the public in 1934. Continuing on down North Street, crossing
Cross Street and Richmond, we come to North Square where the
little boys will not let you miss the famous</p>
<h3>Paul Revere House</h3>
<p>The oldest house in the City of Boston, built in 1660 and purchased
by Paul Revere in 1770; here he resided until 1800. The immense
fireplaces, the ancient wallpaper and many other features
from the Colonial period make it a most interesting house to visit.
Admission twenty-five cents. Open from 10 a. m. to 4 p. m., daily.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">

<p class="center"><span class="small">PAUL REVERE&rsquo;S HOUSE</span></p>
</div>
<p>Leaving the Paul Revere House, we turn left at North Bennett
Street and proceed to Salem Street where we turn right on our way
to the</p>
<h3>Old North Church</h3>
<p>This is the oldest church edifice in Boston. It was built in 1723.
The signal lanterns of Paul Revere displayed in the steeple of this
church on April 18, 1775, warned the people of the march of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
British to Concord and Lexington. Don&rsquo;t fail to ask the sexton to
show you the old communion chest recently found, and the statues
which are reported to have been seized from a French ship, bound
for a monastery in Montreal. Illustrated history of the church and
admission to the steeple will cost fifty cents. Otherwise, admission
is free from 9 a. m. until 5 p. m. Regular services Sunday.</p>
<p>Leaving the church, follow down Hull Street to</p>
<h3>Copp&rsquo;s Hill Burying Ground</h3>
<p>Here is the tomb of Edmund Hartt, builder of &ldquo;Old Ironsides,&rdquo;
Robert Newman, the patriot who displayed the signal lanterns in
the tower of the Old North Church, and many other men of
Colonial times.</p>
<p>Leaving Copp&rsquo;s Hill Burying Ground, turn right on Charter
Street and proceed to Commercial Street. Then turn left, following
Commercial Street around to the Charlestown bridge, turning
right on Chelsea Street, on the Charlestown side of the bridge, and
right again at Navy Street, leading to the entrance gate of the</p>
<h3>Boston Navy Yard</h3>
<p>The Boston Navy Yard has been in continuous operation since
1800. It covers approximately 123&frac12; acres and has nearly one and
one-half miles of waterfront, three dry docks, a marine railway,
ten ship piers, and about one hundred and fifty buildings within
its enclosure. It is designated as a building yard. All rope used in
the United States Navy is manufactured here. Another interesting
fact is that the chains used overseas in planting mines that formed
a net against German U boats were made at the forge shop. You
will be asked to leave your camera with the guard at the gate who
will also direct you to the famous</p>
<h3>United States Frigate Constitution</h3>
<p>Built by Edmund Hartt and launched September 20, 1797, &ldquo;Old
Ironsides,&rdquo; as she is familiarly known, was in about forty engagements
and never suffered defeat. She has been rebuilt and restored
to her former condition by the school children of the United States.
Leaving the &ldquo;Constitution,&rdquo; we travel back to the main gate and
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
out on to Chelsea Street once more. Here we turn right on Chelsea
Street and left on Tremont Street to the</p>
<h3>Bunker Hill Monument</h3>
<p>Here you will see a granite obelisk, two hundred and twenty-one
feet high on Breed&rsquo;s Hill, within the lines of the American Redoubt
which was the center of the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775.
Open to the public daily from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m., the admission
fee being ten cents.</p>
<p>Leaving the monument, we go down Lexington Street to City
Square where we take the elevated train to North Station. Arriving
at North Station, go downstairs and take the subway back to
Arlington Street where we leave the subway and return to our
starting point.</p>

<br /><span class="large"><i>SUBURBAN BOSTON</i></span><br /><span class="large">&#9733;</span></h2>
<h3>The Start</h3>
<p>Let us get into our automobile in front of the Hotel Statler on the
Providence Street side. Swing left around the island and right at
Arlington Street and again right at Boylston Street along which we
drive to Charles Street, where we turn left. Proceed along Charles
Street with the Boston Common on our right and the Public
Gardens on our left and continue to the first rotary traffic circle
where we swing around, by the AMOCO Service Station and cross
the Longfellow Bridge (made famous by Longfellow&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;I
stood on the bridge at midnight&rdquo;). Arriving on the Cambridge
shore, go sharp right and follow around to the right on to</p>
<h3>Memorial Drive</h3>
<p>This drive runs along the beautiful Charles River on which the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University
boat crews train. As we roll along the drive, we come to the famous
Massachusetts Institute of Technology on our right. From this
school have graduated many of our best technical men. On our
left as we drive along, we see Harvard Bridge, the Tech Boat
House and the Weld Boat House. Across the Charles, we see the
Harvard Business School, while on our right we begin to pass the
&ldquo;houses&rdquo; of Harvard College. Continuing along the drive to Mt.
Auburn Street, we turn left. A short way down Mt. Auburn Street
on our left we pass the Stillman Infirmary, maintained as a hospital
for Harvard students, and the Cambridge Hospital. On the
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
river bank directly in the rear of this group of buildings is the
supposed site of Leif Erickson&rsquo;s old house built in the year 1001.
Continue on Mt. Auburn Street two blocks to Coolidge Avenue
and turn left. On our right is</p>
<h3>Mt. Auburn Cemetery</h3>
<p>Sometimes called &ldquo;The Cemetery of Poets&rdquo; for here are buried
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, Oliver
Wendell Holmes, Charles Sumner, Edward Everett, Louis Agassiz
and Phillips Brooks. Run the car about one-tenth of a mile along
the cemetery fence and stop. Through the fence one can see the
beautiful tomb of Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Christian
Science Church. After admiring the beautiful setting, we turn our
car about and travel back to Mt. Auburn Street, where we turn
right and then left on Elmwood Avenue, on the corner of which
stands</p>
<h3>The James Russell Lowell House</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" alt="THE JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL HOUSE" width="500" height="260" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">THE JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL HOUSE</span></p>
</div>
<p>Built in 1767. Used as a hospital during the Battle of Bunker Hill.
Later Benedict Arnold used it as his headquarters for three weeks.
James Russell Lowell was born here in 1819. Follow Elmwood
Avenue to Brattle Street where we turn right. On our left we see
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the Fayerweather House and the Nichols House, both built in
1660. Further down Brattle Street, we come to the Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow House, built in 1759. Turning left at Mason
Street we pass Radcliffe College. In 1894 the Society for the Collegiate
Instruction of Women or more familiarly the &ldquo;Harvard
Annex&rdquo; was incorporated as Radcliffe College. Named after Lady
Moulson, n&eacute;e Ann Radcliffe, who was the first woman to make
a gift of money to Harvard. We follow Mason Street to the</p>
<h3>Cambridge Common</h3>
<p>Directly in the center of the street we find the tablet which marks
the spot where stood the famous elm under which Washington took
command of the Army on July 3, 1775. The tree itself collapsed of
old age in 1923. Turning right we come to</p>
<h3>Christ Church</h3>
<p>Built in 1761 by the Tories, it was used by the Provincial troops
as a barracks during the siege of Boston and the lead pipe&rsquo;s of the
organ were melted for bullets. Washington attended services here
New Year&rsquo;s Eve 1775. We pass from the Church yard to the Old
Burying Ground which contains the bodies of numerous Colonial
people. At the edge of the cemetery we find an old granite milestone
which bears the inscription &ldquo;Boston 8 miles 1734.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering our car we swing left around the Common following
the traffic arrows and pass</p>
<h3>Harvard University</h3>
<p>This is the oldest and in many ways the most distinguished school
of learning in the United States. Built in 1636. However, this
priority is oftentimes disputed as William and Mary College in
Virginia claims its date of charter to be 1617. In order to visit
Harvard you should set aside a whole day. Secure a guide by applying
to Room L in University Hall, and everything of interest
will be included in this day&rsquo;s adventure. Today let us continue
by turning right on Kirkland Street, passing the Harvard Law
School on our left and Memorial Hall on our right. Turn left at
Oxford Street. That big building on your right is the University
Museum. Here is located the Agassiz Museum of glass flowers, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
even if we must hurry, let us stop and view this unique collection.
After our visit we continue to Everett Street where we turn left,
passing the huge tennis courts on our left and continue to Massachusetts
Avenue where we turn right.</p>

</div>
<p>We are now on the famous course over which the British passed
on their way to Lexington and Concord, April 18, 1775. We shall
follow Massachusetts Avenue clear through to Concord. After passing
through Cambridge and North Cambridge, the first town we
come to is</p>
<h3>Arlington</h3>
<p>Here at the corner of Pleasant and Massachusetts Avenue occurred
a minor skirmish when Colonists attacked a British Commissary.
Next we come to Jason Street on which stands</p>
<h3>The Jason Russell House</h3>
<p>It was near this point that the first battle on the fateful day of
April 19, 1775 was fought. Over half of the Colonists killed that
day met their death here in a fearful hand to hand struggle with
the British. This house is open to the public April to October,
admission free, from 2 p. m. to 5 p. m.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>We will continue on our way till we come to the Lexington
Green. We park our car in front of</p>
<h3>Buckman Tavern</h3>
<p>In this historic tavern the Minute Men gathered and waited in
the tap room for the British. We stand in front of the old bar and
almost seem to hear the clank of the tankards. There are the old
bullet moulds, the powder horns, the bullet holes left in the old
door from stray shots of the British, the old bedrooms and furnishings
which carry you back to those days when the Colonists
fought for liberty. Admission to the tavern is free.</p>
<p>Leaving the Tavern, cross the street to the Green and view the
statue erected in honor of the Minute Men. Next walk over to that
big boulder and read the immortal command:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Stand your ground.</p>
<p class="t0">Don&rsquo;t fire unless fired upon.</p>
<p class="t0">But if they mean to have war</p>
<p class="t0">Let it begin here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">Captain Parker</p>
</div>
<p>We now go back to the car and drive past the Green to Hancock
Street. Turn right and drive to the</p>
<h3>Hancock Clark House</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" alt="HARRINGTON HOUSE" width="500" height="252" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">HARRINGTON HOUSE</span></p>
</div>
<p>Built in 1698 and enlarged in 1734. From 1698 to 1805 it was occupied
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
successively by Reverend John Hancock and Reverend
Jonas Clark. Adams and Hancock were staying here the morning
of April 19, 1775, when Paul Revere rode into town warning them
that the British were coming. You will find the contents of the
house most interesting. A historian is present to answer questions.
Admission is free. House open 11 a. m. to 4 p. m.</p>
<p>Leaving the house turn the car around and drive back to Bedford
Street. On the corner of Bedford Street and Elm Avenue stands
the</p>
<h3>Jonathan Harrington House</h3>
<p>Jonathan Harrington was the first mortally wounded Minute
Man. He made his way from the Green to the house, falling dead
at his wife&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<img src="images/i011.jpg" alt="WAYSIDE" width="500" height="254" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">WAYSIDE</span></p>
</div>
<p>Passing by the house, we come to the old burial ground on our
left. Turning right and following Massachusetts Avenue, we
come to U. S. Route 2A, where you will see a marker on the
right hand side of the road which reads as follows: &ldquo;This bluff
was used as a rallying point by the British April 19, 1775. After
a sharp fight they retreated to Fiske Hill from which they were
driven in great confusion.&rdquo; We bear right here and continue.
<sup>8</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of a mile from this point we come to two ice cream parlors,
one on each side of the road. Drive in the right hand one. Here
we find a monument telling the story of &ldquo;The Capture of Paul
Revere.&rdquo; William Dawes, who also rode from Boston, escaped
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
the British, leaving Dr. Prescott alone to carry the news of
the British advance. After being questioned, Revere returned
home. As we approach Concord we come to</p>
<h3>&ldquo;The Wayside&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This was the only house ever owned by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It
was also the girlhood home of Louisa M. Alcott and was later occupied
by Margaret Sidney (Mrs. Daniel Lothrop), authoress of
&ldquo;Five Little Peppers.&rdquo; It is interesting to know that three authors
with no connection or relationship all occupied this house. Miss
Margaret Lothrop, daughter of the authoress, now owns the house
and will personally conduct you through it. Don&rsquo;t fail to stop. You
will live with Hawthorne, Alcott and Sidney under her guiding
hand. Open 10 a. m. to 6 p. m., admission 25c. The next house on
the right is the Louisa M. Alcott house. Drive on into Concord.
Pass the Green and turn right at Monument Street. About one-half
mile down this street, we come to the old Battle Field. Park your
car in the space provided and walk through the Parkway to the</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small">CONCORD BRIDGE</span></p>
</div>
<h3>Concord Bridge</h3>
<p>Here we see the grave of the unknown British soldiers and the
Minute Man statue, erected to the heroes &ldquo;who fired the shot
heard round the world.&rdquo; You will be impressed by the beautiful
surroundings and the silence. When you have dreamed long enough,
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
get in the car, drive back to Concord Green, turn left on to Route
126. Follow 126 out of town. You will come to</p>
<h3>Lake Walden</h3>
<p>Here the great nature author, Thoreau, wrote many of his works.
Continuing for about 7 miles on Route 126 to Wayland, we come
to Route 20, the old Boston &amp; Albany Post Road. We turn right
and drive westward about 5&frac12; miles through So. Sudbury till we
reach a roadway on the right leading to</p>
<h3>&ldquo;The Wayside Inn&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Originally called Howe&rsquo;s Tavern and later Red Horse Tavern,
in 1863 it was named &ldquo;The Wayside Inn.&rdquo; It was here that Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow wrote the &ldquo;Tales of a Wayside Inn.&rdquo; The
house and grounds are now owned and maintained by Mr. Henry
Ford. At the gatehouse you will find the stage coach used to bring
General LaFayette to Boston for the laying of the cornerstone of
Bunker Hill Monument in 1825.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

<p class="center"><span class="small">WAYSIDE INN</span></p>
</div>
<p>Register, step up to the bar and order your lunch, after which
you may wander through the Inn until you are called by the host.
After you have eaten in the dining room (built in 1800) walk out
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
through the gardens. You will find the old grist mill interesting
and unique. Also, don&rsquo;t fail to visit the Old School House spoken
of in the famous poem &ldquo;Mary Had a Little Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After you have seen everything on this historic estate get back
in the car and visit the old country store. Drive back to Boston
over Route 20 to Commonwealth Avenue and Clarendon Street
where you turn right crossing Newbury and Boylston Streets.
Turning left at St. James Avenue will bring you back to the door
of the Hotel Statler.</p>

<p>Ask the people at your hotel to direct you to the nearest subway
and ride to Park Street. As you leave the car at Park Street, you
are in the oldest subway in the world, except, perhaps, the one in
Budapest which always has disputed with Boston this particular
claim. This subway was opened in Boston in September, 1897.
Going up the stairs, you will emerge from the subway onto the
famous Boston Common. Turn left, and you will have no trouble
in finding the</p>
<h3>State House</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" alt="STATE HOUSE" width="500" height="260" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">STATE HOUSE</span></p>
</div>
<p>Located on Beacon Street at the head of Park Street. The hill on
which the State House stands was originally called Treamount,
later this was changed to Sentry Hill when it was used as a lookout,
and after the erection of the Beacon in 1634-1635, it received
the name of Beacon Hill. The cornerstone of the &ldquo;Bulfinch&rdquo; front
of the State House was laid on July 4, 1795, and the extension was
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
built in 1889 at a cost of four million dollars. The construction of
the east and west wings was completed in 1916. The State House is
decorated with statuary, historic paintings, battle flags and war
relics. The House of Representatives contains the celebrated Cod
Fish emblems. The gilded dome, lighted at night by four hundred
and ninety-eight electric lights, makes a magnificent display. Open
to the public on week days from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m., and on Saturday
from 9 a. m. to 12 noon.</p>
<p>Leaving the State House, walk straight down Beacon Street with
the Boston Common on your left. Cross Charles Street and enter
the</p>
<h3>Public Gardens</h3>
<p>This is about one-half the size of the Common and contains an
artificial pond of irregular shape, the beauty of which is enhanced
by the graceful swan boats which glide over its surface. A monument
commemorating the discovery of ether is erected at one
side of the Gardens; thousands of men and women visit this shrine
yearly. Proceed through this beautiful Shrine of Nature, coming
out at Arlington Street and Newbury Street, on the corner of
which stands the</p>

<p>This is one of Boston&rsquo;s finest hotels, noted for its hospitality, excellent
food and social events.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Continuing on down Newbury Street, we come to Berkeley
Street, on the corner of which stands</p>
<h3>Museum of Natural History</h3>
<p>The building is full of New England economic, geological, and
special mineral collections, mammals, birds, fishes, fossils, plants,
marine invertebrates, and insects beautifully mounted. The building
is open to the public free of charge daily from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m.,
and on Sundays from 1 to 4:30 p. m.</p>
<p>Leaving the Museum of Natural History, turn right at Boylston
Street and proceed to</p>
<h3>Copley Square</h3>
<p>This is architecturally considered one of the finest municipal
squares in the country, if not in the world. On your left is Boston&rsquo;s
famous</p>
<h3>Trinity Church</h3>
<p>The facade of this church is one of the richest examples of ecclesiastical
architecture in the city. Mr. H. H. Richardson was the
architect. Interior decorative work by John LaFarge. St. Gaudens&rsquo;
statue of Phillips Brooks is on the Huntington Avenue side. In the
cloister are stones from old St. Botolph&rsquo;s Church in Boston, England.
Bishop Brooks was rector of Trinity from 1869 to 1891.</p>
<p>To the left of the church and across St. James Avenue is the</p>
<h3>Copley Plaza Hotel</h3>
<p>It is and has been for twenty years New England&rsquo;s distinctive
society hotel. The main ballroom is decorated in the style of Louis
XIV with marble bases and gray Sienna stone for walls. The
Sheraton Room opening directly off the lobby is furnished in
Italian Renaissance style. The main cafe contains the celebrated
Merry-Go-Round bar, a unique attraction. Directly in front of
you is the</p>
<h3>Boston Public Library</h3>
<p>Designed after the style of the Italian Renaissance by McKim,
Meade &amp; White, the interior of the building is of great beauty and
visitors come from all parts of the world to admire it. Famous
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
murals by Pierre Cecile Puvis de Chavannes, Edwin Austin Abbey,
and John Singer Sargent will hold you spellbound. Visitors are
advised to purchase the handbook of the Boston Public Library,
on the second floor, for thirty-five cents in order to remember the
various art treasures.</p>

</div>
<p>Leaving the Public Library, turning right on Huntington Avenue
and proceeding past Mechanics Building, home of Boston Automobile
Shows and other notable expositions, we continue on Huntington
Avenue to Norway Street and turn right to the</p>
<h3>Christian Science Church</h3>
<p>Rising over the city&rsquo;s roofs and spires is the great white dome of
The First Church of Christ, Scientist, affectionately known as the
&ldquo;Mother Church.&rdquo; In Boston, the Christian Science movement
was founded, and its administrative center is there. The branch
churches of Christ, Scientist, are to be found in almost every part
of the civilized world.</p>
<p>The original edifice, completed and dedicated in 1895 with a
seating capacity of 1,000 persons, soon became inadequate to accommodate
those desiring to attend its services. Accordingly, in
1905 there was erected the extension, crowned by the majestic
dome reaching to a height of two hundred and twenty-four feet
above the street, having a diameter of eighty-two feet. The auditorium
seats approximately five thousand. It required two years to
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
build and cost nearly two million dollars. It was dedicated in June,
1906, and like all Christian Science ventures, it was free of debt.
No funerals, marriages or social entertainments add to its income.
The church is built of Indiana limestone and New Hampshire
granite, New Hampshire being the native state of Mary Baker
Eddy, the discoverer and founder of Christian Science. The great
organ is a notable instrument, its gilded pipes rising behind the
quiet and dignified rostrum whereon stand the two desks for the
readers who conduct the services. The general effect is one of
breadth, spaciousness, and all pervading light. Within and without,
the church demands attention and admiration as one of the largest
and most impressive churches in the world.</p>
<p>Leaving the Christian Science Church, we go directly to Massachusetts
Avenue, and turning left come to</p>
<h3>Horticultural Hall</h3>
<p>Here Boston holds most of its famous flower shows. Across the
street is the home of</p>

</div>
<h3>The Boston Symphony Orchestra</h3>
<p>The Boston Symphony Orchestra is something more than half a
century old. More notable than the span of its years is its place
in the growth of musical America. In 1881, the late Major Henry
L. Higginson realized the first dream and aspiration of his life by
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
founding in Boston an orchestra of European standards, a phenomenon
then unknown in America. The idea had come to him as
a student in Vienna. It was an ambitious dream of an impecunious
young man but after many years, having made his fortune as a
banker, he was able to give the Boston Symphony Orchestra to
the world. He engaged the finest musicians in Europe and brought
to this country a succession of the greatest conductors of their
time. He set a new precedent by exacting of the musicians entire
devotion of their talent to the orchestra. He gave entire artistic
freedom to the conductor. The wisdom of these policies soon
showed as each conductor expended his genius to the cumulative
improvement of an ensemble which soon had the world&rsquo;s attention.
The present director is the famous Dr. Serge Koussevitsky who
began in 1924, and his term as conductor has extended far beyond
any single term of the ten previous conductors. The long association
of such an orchestra with such a leader is eloquently justified
by the results. The great Russian conductor has brought new
beauties to the Boston Symphony Orchestra, a fresh importance
and distinction reflected in the greatly enlarged public. The festivals
and special choral concerts, the broadened repertory, new
and old, of the regular concerts and the quality of each performance
are as indefinable as the genius which directs them. After
you have viewed the auditorium and the huge organ, almost directly
across the street on the corner of Gainsboro and Huntington
Avenue, we find the famous</p>
<h3>New England Conservatory of Music</h3>
<p>The New England Conservatory of Music was founded in 1867.
Hand in hand with the development of modern America, it soon
reached a leading position among music schools in this country.
Students from many parts of the world have come to this seat of
musical learning and, again, have departed with a thorough technical
and artistic training in their possession.</p>
<p>The school buildings are especially adapted for the many details
of thorough musical instruction. There are three concert
halls, with a total seating capacity of over 2,000; a large library,
with many rare volumes; a fine concert organ and fourteen other
organs for teaching and practice purposes; and, added to these,
seventy-five class rooms and private studios.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>A walk through the buildings confirms the impression that here
is a veritable beehive of musical activity.</p>
<p>From the Conservatory of Music, we cross Huntington Avenue
once more and continue about one block south, reaching the</p>
<h3>Boston Opera House</h3>
<p>Located on the corner of Opera Place, which was formerly called
St. Stephen&rsquo;s, for years it has been used for the Metropolitan Opera
singers, as well as local opera. Leaving the Opera House, we again
turn right on Huntington Avenue and proceed to the</p>
<h3>Museum of Fine Arts</h3>
<p>The Boston Museum of Fine Arts occupies the unique position of
being one of the few museums in the world created and supported
solely by private citizens. The Museum is well equipped with guides
who are commissioned to explain to the visitors any part of the
collection about which one wishes to know. In this little book, we
cannot begin to describe the contents of the Museum of Fine Arts,
but we hope you will discover its beauties for yourself.</p>

we find the Wentworth Institute. On our right we see Simmons
College for Women, south of which, on the corner of Longwood
Avenue, we find the Harvard Medical School. To the west of Simmons

garden adds much to its loveliness, and as a special treat for the
visitors, they may also go through the Hooper Hathaway house,
once known as the old bakery, and which formerly stood at Washington

<h3>Manchester-by-the-Sea</h3>
<p>One of the oldest towns on the North Shore. The old Town House
built in 1809 is still used as a Congregational Church. The little
one story houses scattered here and there carry you back to the
days of the Puritan Fathers. The old cemetery in which the first
interment was made in 1661 is also interesting.</p>
<h3>Magnolia</h3>

</div>
<p>Proceed to Pearce Street where turn right on to Main Street.
Follow to the</p>
<h3>Gorton-Pew Fish Company</h3>
<p>To see the name Gorton is to think of fish. Here one can secure
permission to visit the canneries. The history of this great company
goes back to 1623 when the Pilgrim Fathers founded Gloucester.
There is every evidence to prove that the present officers are
descendants of the original settlers even though the present company
had its organization in 1849. It is interesting to note that the
pilgrims shipped the first cargo of fish to Spain in 1623.</p>

<p>If you are not too tired you may continue on your way over the
shore road making the complete trip around Cape Ann, a promontory
which extends out into the Atlantic Ocean with its beautiful
entrancing rocks, beaches and rolling sea. This route is a most
interesting panorama. You will pass the largest lobster fishery in
America. It is impossible for you to get lost as the road winds
around and back into Gloucester, where you may retrace your

Road where we turn right passing under the Longfellow
Bridge to Beacon Street. At Beacon Street, turn right and again

which is</p>
<h3>&ldquo;The House of the Shamrock&rdquo;</h3>
<p>affectionate name for the home of the Honorable James Michael
Curley, three times mayor of Boston and later governor of Massachusetts.
His life has been one of romance and reads like a page
from Alger&mdash;a poor boy, who through his own efforts became
governor of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>We continue on Route 3 to the junction of Route 37 and turn
right on to Granite Avenue, soon crossing the</p>
<h3>Neponset River</h3>
<p>It is a salt water river which rises and falls with the tides. A little
further along on your left is</p>
<h3>The Wollaston Golf Club</h3>
<p>Considered one of Boston&rsquo;s finest clubs although it offers little
in scenic beauty. The course is well laid out and the hazards good.</p>

<p>Follow Granite Avenue to East Milton. Turn left at Route 135.
This is Adams Street. This street received its name from the two
Presidents. Follow straight on this street until you come to</p>
<h3>The Adams Mansion</h3>
<p><i>Both</i> John Adams and John Quincy Adams made this old mansion
their home during the later years of their lives. John Adams
celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of Independence Day on July
4, 1826 in this old house. Open 9 a. m. to 4 p. m., admission 25c.</p>
<p>Leaving this charming old place, continue on Adams Street to
Hancock Street which you follow to the</p>
<h3>First Parish Church</h3>
<p>It was established in 1689. Both John Adams and John Quincy
Adams are buried in this church. In order to go down to the crypt,
it is necessary to get in touch with the janitor or sexton who is
always willing to accommodate those desirous of visiting the final
resting place of these two early Presidents.</p>
<p>Leaving the Church, follow Hancock Street to School Street and
turn right. Follow the street car tracks along School Street, turning
left at Franklin and continue to the</p>
<h3>John Adams House</h3>
<p><i>Here</i> on October 19, 1735, John Adams, the second President of
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
the United States, was born. It is a most interesting house, having
much of the old furniture, and is kept in good condition. Next door
is the</p>
<h3>John Quincy Adams House</h3>
<p>Here on July 11, 1767, the sixth President of the United States
was born. It is filled with antiques and evokes stirring memories.
Historians are in both houses to answer questions. Both houses are
open every day from 10 a. m. to 5 p. m. Admission 25c to each

<p>After you have visited these two historic houses, turn the car
around and retrace your journey over Franklin to School Street,
turning right and continue to Quincy Avenue where you again
turn right and follow to Route 3. This route soon brings us to
Weymouth Landing and then to</p>
<h3>Weymouth</h3>
<p>This town was noted in history for being the location of Arnold&rsquo;s
Tavern where the committee of safety met in the days of and before
the Revolution. You pass the outskirts of Hingham, Duxbury,
and soon come to the center of Kingston. You are now nearing
Plymouth, whose historic doors are always open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h3>Plymouth</h3>
<p>It is a city with thriving industries and all the pleasures to be
found in New England&rsquo;s summer resorts. If you wish to study the
historic side, it would be wise for you to close your eyes to the
modern side of this community and drive along Route 3 to Chilton
Street where you turn left and then right again at the waterfront
and continue to</p>
<h3>Plymouth Rock</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" alt="PLYMOUTH ROCK" width="500" height="236" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">PLYMOUTH ROCK</span></p>
</div>
<p>The rock is located easily. A beautiful canopy of granite has been
erected over the historic stone. To protect it from souvenir
hunters, it was necessary to build a steel fence around it. To the
stranger who does not know the true topography of Massachusetts
but who recalls various poems and songs, it is always a surprise
not to find a &ldquo;stern and rock-bound coast.&rdquo; Sand is in great
abundance, the beaches and sand bluffs extending in all directions.
Recalling your history, you can picture the Mayflower failing to
weather the Cape, putting in to this safe but shallow harbor.
Myles Standish had already explored and reported back at Provincetown,
where the ship had anchored, &ldquo;good water in the brook
and timber on the hills for homes.&rdquo; Winter was coming and it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
advisable to settle, and so these heroic people landed here. One
hundred and two souls, according to history, had journeyed to this
new country to find religious freedom for themselves. Turning
from the rock, climb the stairway leading up the grassy bluff to</p>
<h3>Cole&rsquo;s Hill</h3>
<p>This is where the Pilgrims buried their fast diminishing band in
the dead of night so that the Indians lurking in the forests could not
determine how many were left. It is a recorded fact that of the one
hundred and two Pilgrims who landed, nearly one-half were buried
during that first sad winter. The Indian monument standing near
the sepulchre is of Massasoit, the great sachem of the Wampanoags.
He was the friend of the Pilgrims and, in reality, their preserver for,
without his kindness, they all would have perished. From Cole&rsquo;s
Hill, go directly left on Carver Street to</p>
<h3>Leyden Street</h3>
<p>Originally named First Street. Just to the left of the junction of
Carver and Leyden Streets was the site of the first &ldquo;Common
House&rdquo; raised in Plymouth. This interesting street has many
markers on it telling the story of Goodman, Winslow, Brewster
and Howland.</p>
<p>Walking straight up Leyden Street, crossing Main Street, we
come to</p>
<h3>The First Parish Church (Unitarian)</h3>
<p>This was the church organization of the Pilgrims. The first church
on this site was erected in 1683. The present church is the fifth to
be built on this site and was completed and dedicated on Forefather&rsquo;s
Day 1899. On your right when facing the First Parish
Church is</p>
<h3>The Church of the Pilgrimage</h3>
<p>This is the Congregational Church and was the result of a division
over doctrinal matters in 1801. The present church was built in
1840. Proceed up the stone steps at the right of the First Parish
Church and you will come to</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h3>Burial Hill</h3>
<p>Here you will find all the interesting graves marked plainly with
yellow signs&mdash;Governor Bradford, Edward Gray, Thomas Clark,
John Howland, John Cotton and others. As we stand here amid
these historic and humble hero dead, we read these significant
words on the obelisk in memory of Governor William Bradford:
&ldquo;Do not basely relinquish what the Fathers with difficulty attained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will have no trouble locating the site of the first fort where
five cannons were placed after great difficulty in 1621. Also, the
grave of General James Warren, soldier, patriot and scholar.</p>
<p>Leaving the graveyard, retrace your steps down Leyden Street
to Main Street. Turn left and then right when you come to</p>
<h3>Middle Street</h3>
<p>This street was once known as King. Little remains of Colonial
days except the street to remind us of old Plymouth. Turn left at
Carver on to</p>
<h3>North Street</h3>
<p>You will find the Edward Winslow House built in 1754. He was
very loyal to the Crown during the Revolution and so the house
was confiscated. Going back to your car, get in and go toward
the Cape on Water Street and soon after you pass Leyden Street,
you come to</p>
<h3>Town Brook</h3>
<p>Here was the drinking water of the Pilgrims. In days of yore, it
was full of alewives, which gave the Puritans fish at their very
door. Even today, trout lurk in many a dark corner of the brook.
In 1909 the town purchased the land here and established the
beautiful Brewster Gardens. Continue on Water Street to Sandwich
Street. Almost in front of you is</p>
<h3>John Howland House</h3>
<p>It was built in 1666 and is called the house of the last Mayflower
Pilgrims in Plymouth. It was restored and put in complete repair
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
by the Howland descendants in 1909. You may drive in and visit,
admission 25c. Open 10 a. m. to 5 p. m. A little way towards the
Cape and you come to Winter Street. Turn left and find</p>
<h3>The Old Harlow House</h3>
<p>It is known better as the Kendall Holmes House after the last
family to live there. It is extremely interesting. The architecture is
simple and therein lies its beauty. The old stairways and open fireplaces
all remain as they were built. The occupants have enjoyed
and loved this old house and so during all these generations there
has been no need to restore as loving hands have cared for it. Retrace
your way towards Boston and on the corner of Chilton and
Court Streets is</p>
<h3>Pilgrim Hall</h3>
<p>It was built in 1824 by the Pilgrim Society and rebuilt and enlarged
in 1880. It is filled with many historic and antique articles.
Park your car in the space provided a short way down Chilton
Street that you may take your time visiting here. Open to the
public daily, admission 25c.</p>

Clyfton Street, turning right on Allerton Street and you arrive
at the</p>
<h3>Pilgrim Monument</h3>
<p>A national monument completed October, 1888, in honor of the
Forefathers of Our Country. Total height eighty-one feet. When
you have read the inscriptions and you have satisfied yourself regarding
the humble beginning of this great country, drive down
Cushman Street to Court, turn left and follow Route 3 to Kingston
where on your right there is a sign marked &ldquo;Duxbury-Marshfield.&rdquo;
Bear right on this road passing soon on your left the</p>
<h3>Major John Bradford House</h3>
<p>built in 1675. It is open to the public and contains many interesting
things. Continue on this old road to</p>
<h3>Duxbury</h3>
<p>Here is easily found the Myles Standish Monument, also the site
of Myles Standish&rsquo;s old house. After your visit here, retrace your
journey to the center of Duxbury, taking the right hand road to
Route 3-A which follow to Alden Street, turning right for the</p>
<h3>John Alden House</h3>
<p>Alden built this house in 1653. It is a quaint old house and has all
the charm of the old Colonial homes. From here go back to Route
3-A. Turn right and follow to a triple fork in the road with signs
marked &ldquo;Marshfield.&rdquo; Take right hand fork called Careswell
Street to</p>
<h3>Governor Edward Winslow House</h3>
<p>It was built in 1699. Contains many antiques. Everything is arranged
to look as if it were still 1700. It is interesting to note that
some of the old colonists lived in sumptuous style. Excellent
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
luncheons, teas and dinners are served here at moderate prices.
The dining room is the old carriage house and the barn has been
turned into a beautiful modern kitchen. The house is open June
1st to October 1st, admission 25c. Leaving here turn left on
Webster Road and see the final home of Daniel Webster. His
tomb may also be visited in the Winslow Cemetery close to the
house.</p>

<br /><span class="large"><i>American Oil Company</i></span>
<br /><span class="smaller">HAS PLAYED A BIG PART IN MAKING HISTORY</span><br /><span class="large">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Just as Boston is proud of the part it has played in the history
of America, so the American Oil Company is proud of
its part in the history of the gasoline and automotive industries.</p>
<p>Starting in 1910 with one horse-drawn tank wagon, the
American Oil Company has grown until it reaches from
Maine to Florida and inland. The American Oil Company
developed Amoco-Gas, the first and original special motor
fuel, in 1915. Amoco-Gas revolutionized the gasoline and
automotive industries&mdash;made possible today&rsquo;s high compression
motor. The first company-operated filling station
in the East was an American Oil Company station. American
Oil Company introduced the first visible gasoline pump&mdash;enabling
motorists to see what they&rsquo;re buying.</p>
<p>The American Oil Company&rsquo;s growth has been built on
one cardinal principle: Honest Values, Honestly Described.</p>
<p>You can be sure you are getting the greatest possible value
when you drive in at the Amoco Sign of Greater Values.
American&rsquo;s Big Three of Quality are: Amoco-Gas, which
holds more official world&rsquo;s records than any other motor
fuel; American Gas, the best buy at regular gas price; Amoco
Motor Oil, made from choice selected paraffine base crudes.</p>
<p>Drive in at the Sign of Greater Values&mdash;from Maine to
Florida and inland.</p>
